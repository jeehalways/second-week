# Callback and Array Method Challenges

This repository contains JavaScript/TypeScript challenges focused on practicing functions, callbacks, and array methods. The challenges are structured in three progressive difficulty levels to accommodate different skill levels.

## üéØ Goal

Practice using functions, callbacks, and array methods in JavaScript with TypeScript type annotations.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Setup Your Project

1. Clone this repository or create a new folder called `callback-challenges`
2. Navigate to the project directory
3. Install TypeScript dependencies:

```bash
npm init -y
npm install -D typescript ts-node @types/node
npx tsc --init
```

4. Create a file called `challenges.ts`
5. Copy the starter code from the provided gist:
   [Challenge Starter Code](https://gist.github.com/mvdgragt/73cd421926bae60f7097e9764b41ebec)

## üìä Challenge Levels

Choose your path based on your current skill level:

### üü¢ Level 1 (Beginner)

**Challenges 1-5**

- Basic function syntax
- Simple callbacks
- Introduction to array methods
- Fundamental JavaScript concepts

### üü° Level 2 (Intermediate)

**Challenges 6-12**

- More complex array methods
- Callback function composition
- Intermediate JavaScript patterns
- Working with multiple data types

### üî¥ Level 3 (Advanced)

**Challenges 13-24**

- Advanced array method chaining
- Complex callback scenarios
- Higher-order functions
- Advanced JavaScript techniques

> üí° **Tip**: You can stop after completing one level or continue if you're feeling confident!

## üõ†Ô∏è Workflow

### Step-by-Step Process

1. **Read** the comment above each challenge
2. **Write** your solution in the function
3. **Uncomment** the console.log lines to test your solution
4. **Run** your code to verify it works
5. **Mark** the challenge as done (add "‚úÖ DONE" comment above it)

### Example Workflow

```typescript
// ‚úÖ DONE - Challenge 1
function challenge1() {
  // Your solution here
}

// Currently working on...
function challenge2() {
  // Your solution here
}
```

## ‚è∏Ô∏è Checkpoints

**Important**: After every 3 challenges, take a break!

1. Run your file: `npx ts-node challenges.ts`
2. Make sure all solved challenges log the correct answers
3. Take a **5-minute break** if you feel tired
4. Continue with the next set of challenges

### Running Your Code

```bash
npx ts-node challenges.ts
```

## üéì Learning Objectives

By completing these challenges, you will:

- Master JavaScript array methods (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `forEach`, etc.)
- Understand callback function patterns and usage
- Practice TypeScript type annotations
- Develop problem-solving skills with functional programming concepts
- Build confidence with higher-order functions

## üìö Key Concepts Covered

- **Callbacks**: Functions passed as arguments to other functions
- **Array Methods**: Built-in methods for array manipulation
- **Higher-Order Functions**: Functions that work with other functions
- **Functional Programming**: Programming paradigm using functions as first-class citizens
- **TypeScript**: Adding type safety to JavaScript

## üîß Technical Requirements

- Use TypeScript for all solutions
- Add proper type annotations
- No `any` types allowed
- Code should compile without errors
- All console outputs should match expected results
